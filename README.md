## Arabam.com Redesign Concept Project



### Greetings everyone! I was greatly impressed by the UI/UX design work for arabam.com redesign previously created by [Reyyan Karataş](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyyankaratas/). Whenever I found the time, I attempted to implement the frontend part, and I can say that I learned a lot during the process.


### I would like to express my gratitude to [Reyyan Karataş](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyyankaratas/) for allowing me to work on this project.
